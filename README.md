# Prompt-engineering
I've assigned my AI to handle sentiment analysis and language translation tasks. The code I created clearly demonstrates how to use prompt engineering templates to guide the AI in completing specific tasks effectively. 

The outputs for sentiment analysis and autofill are structured in JSON format, making them easy to use for further analysis.

To begin, I import the necessary modules and use OpenAI’s helper functions to process prompts according to the instructions I provide. It’s best practice to store your OpenAI API Key as an environment variable to keep it secure.

For this project, I used the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, though you can experiment with GPT-4 or any other preferred model.

I generated a set of 20 sample reviews using ChatGPT to serve as my dataset (feel free to use your own). I then instructed the AI to carry out several tasks and return the results in JSON format. I applied the same approach to contract data, asking the AI to translate content from English to Swahili.

Prompt engineering plays a key role in improving the accuracy of responses from language models, especially since they can sometimes produce inaccurate or irrelevant answers. By crafting well-structured prompts, you help the AI stay focused on the task. Honestly, it’s a fun and engaging process. Give it a shot sometime!
